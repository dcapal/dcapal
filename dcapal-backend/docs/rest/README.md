# DcaPal REST API Documentation

This document provides REST API endpoints documentation for DcaPal backend. 

Endpoints are divided in *public* and *internal* families: public APIs are intended for Developers wishing to integrate their tools or apps with DcaPal, whereas *internal* APIs are meant to be called by DcaPal client only. Furthermore, endpoints are classified as *open* or *authorized*: open APIs can be freely called and do not require authentication, while authorized APIs require authentication and access to resources is constrained by visibility rules.

> #### ℹ️ Base URL
> When not specified, endpoints always assume `https://dcapal.com/api/` base URL
